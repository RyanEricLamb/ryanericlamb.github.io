## SIDE PROJECTS
In my spare time I enjoy developing solutions that focus on alleviating an immediate pain-point, and can be presented in a simple and intuitive interface to the end-user. Some example public projects and walkthroughs that I've done:
- [Using machine learning to predict sport scores](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-machine-learning-to-predict-sport-scores-a-rugby-world-cup-example-f699fd552673?source=friends_link&sk=052e7a0d71f68421a97e1996f3b05727). Predicting the success of rugby teams at the Rugby World Cup. Article has over 10,000 views.
- [An end-to-end machine learning project with Python Pandas, Keras, Flask, Docker and Heroku](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-end-to-end-machine-learning-project-with-python-pandas-keras-flask-docker-and-heroku-c987018c42c7?source=friends_link&sk=c3eed1e399d67d82bb67fb33e4adbada). A high-level overview of the key steps to go from raw data to a live deployed machine learning app. Article has over 44,000 views. 
- [A data engineering project with Prefect, Docker, Terraform, Google CloudRun, BigQuery and Streamlit](https://medium.com/@ryanelamb/a-data-engineering-project-with-prefect-docker-terraform-google-cloudrun-bigquery-and-streamlit-3fc6e08b9398?source=friends_link&sk=c83c07681d2af63d8292c2bac9e4287a). Uses UK Open Bus Data to calculate late buses in real-time for any selected region.
- Created an automated SaaS for instant passport appointment alerts (no longer running). Built with minimal running costs (<Â£5 per month) and received first paying customers within first two weeks.
- Used machine learning (Tensorflow) to automatically crop headshot images relative to face location. Packaged as desktop app, removed the need for manual image cropping and increased output by factor 8x.
- Created a video editing app that automatically appends intro and outro clips to video files in bulk, reducing human effort by 75%. 
- Created a payroll validation and invoice generation app that can automatically generate 100s of bespoke invoices using only an Excel file as input.
