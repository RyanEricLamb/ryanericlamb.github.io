I'm Ryan, CTO at [The Really Great Teacher Company](https://reallygreatteachers.com/), where I work across tech, product, recruitment and operations. 

I hold a MSc in Physics and Engineering in Medicine from University College London and am a Chartered Global Management Accountant (ACMA, CGMA).

I'm interested in data science, data engineering, operational improvement, automation and getting stuck into succinct work that produces immediate results.

I live in Leeds, UK.

## PROJECTS
Some example public projects and walkthroughs that I've done:
- [Using machine learning to predict sport scores](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/using-machine-learning-to-predict-sport-scores-a-rugby-world-cup-example-f699fd552673). Article has over 10,000 views.
- [An end-to-end machine learning project with Python Pandas, Keras, Flask, Docker and Heroku](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/an-end-to-end-machine-learning-project-with-python-pandas-keras-flask-docker-and-heroku-c987018c42c7). A high-level overview of the key steps needed in going from raw data to a live deployed machine learning app. Article has over 44,000 views. 
- [A data engineering project with Prefect, Docker, Terraform, Google CloudRun, BigQuery and Streamlit]. Uses UK Open Bus Data to calculate late buses in realtime for any selected region.
- Created an automated SaaS for instant passport appointment alerts (no longer running). Built with minimal running costs (<Â£5 per month) and received first paying customers within first two weeks.
- Used machine learning (Tensorflow) to automatically crop headshot images relative to face location. Packaged as desktop app, removed the need for manual image cropping and increased output by factor 8x.
